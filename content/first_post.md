Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for our pelican blog. We're using it for the 100 days of web course.


## Big heading for a big day

This is the first paragraph of our article - huzzah!

We're writing this in markdown format so we can use two * to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text

### Smaller header

We can use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italicized* word

THE END! (cool story Bro!)
