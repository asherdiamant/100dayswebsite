### Second Post - isn't it awesome?

I'm writing a second post on VSCode, which seems odd for a blog creation tool. But since I'm 
using *Pelican* to generate the site, any text editor will do.

 this is a code block, I hope
 oh, I think I got it now

### What's next?

Next I will try to create a post in Ulysses, and see how it goes.
